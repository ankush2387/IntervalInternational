===================================

This Brightcove Master Service Agreement (the "<u>Agreement</u>") is by and between Brightcove Inc. ("<u>Brightcove</u>") and the entity or individual ("<u>Company</u>") identified in the order submitted by Company (each, an "<u>Order</u>") or identified in connection with the Brightcove Account registration process, and governs Company's use, and Brightcove's provision, of the Brightcove Service. Each Order, and any exhibit to an Order, is subject to this Agreement and is incorporated herein by reference. If you are an individual and are entering into this Agreement on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind such entity to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

1. The Brightcove Service.
--------------------------
The "<u>Brightcove Service</u>" means those online services that Company has ordered from Brightcove, including Video Cloud and/or App Cloud, as applicable, and such other online services as Brightcove makes available from time to time. "<u>Video Cloud</u>" is an online video platform that enables Company to upload, manage and distribute Company's Content. "<u>App Cloud</u>" is an online application platform that enables Company to create mobile and other software applications and distribute Company's Content via such applications. App Cloud excludes any portion of the service distributed or otherwise made available via an open source license. As used herein, "<u>Content</u>" means all content, data, video, templates or information in any form that is uploaded to the Brightcove Service by Company or on Company's behalf, including any such Content that is ingested into the Brightcove Service from third parties at the direction of Company, and "App" means an application for the iOS and/or Android platforms, built by Company, or on Company's behalf, using App Cloud. The Brightcove Service does not include Company's Content or Apps or the Content or Apps of any other Brightcove customer. By using the online, user interfaces (collectively, the "<u>U/I</u>") provided as part of the Brightcove Service, Company may make choices about the presentation, management and distribution of the Content and/or Apps. Company may change its selections as permitted by the Brightcove Service. In all cases, however, Company's last selections in the U/I, as reflected in Brightcove's database, shall be conclusive in the event of any dispute concerning Company's selections.

&nbsp;

2. Access to the Brightcove Service; Free Accounts; Beta Services.
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. <u>Access to the Brightcove Service</u>. Access to Company's Brightcove Service Account(s) shall be enabled by use of username(s) and password(s) ("<u>Credentials</u>") selected by Company. An "<u>Account</u>" is a single point of entry via the U/I through which Company accesses and uses the Brightcove Service. Except where Brightcove has actual notice of loss, theft or unauthorized use of Company's Credentials, (i) Company is responsible for all activity occurring in Company's Account(s) and (ii) Brightcove shall have the right, without further inquiry, to rely on the provision of Company's Credentials as sufficient to authenticate Company's use of the Brightcove Service.
2. <u>Free Accounts</u>. Brightcove may, from time to time, offer free Brightcove Service Accounts, such as Video Cloud trial Accounts or App Cloud Core Edition Accounts. Unless otherwise specified during the Account registration process, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall govern the use of such free Accounts. Brightcove may terminate any free Account at any time without notice, in its sole discretion. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE BRIGHTCOVE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND IN CONNECTION WITH FREE ACCOUNTS.
3. <u>Beta Services</u>. Brightcove may, from time to time, offer products or services that are not generally available to all Brightcove customers ("<u>Beta Services</u>"). Unless otherwise indicated, all Beta Services will be offered at no cost and will be identified as "beta" or in a manner that indicates that the Beta Service is in limited or pre-release. Such Beta Services may still be in development and Brightcove may change aspects of the Beta Services at any time, including prior to general release. Company will not be obligated or required to use any Beta Services. Brightcove may cease offering any Beta Services, or cease offering such services at no cost, at any time without notice, in its sole discretion. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, BETA SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

Brightcove will not review or screen Content or Apps on a regular basis for compliance with this Agreement or applicable law, and Brightcove shall have no obligation to do so, provided, however, that in addition to any other rights Brightcove may have, Brightcove reserves the right to suspend Company's access to and/or use of the Brightcove Service, or any particular Content or App, to the extent that Brightcove reasonably determines, in good faith, that such suspension is necessary to comply with applicable law or to prevent significant harm to any end user or the Brightcove Service; provided further, however, that in such event, Brightcove shall use commercially reasonable efforts to suspend only that portion of the Brightcove Service or any particular Content or App, as is reasonably necessary to prevent the occurrence or continuation of such violation and/or harm.
2. <u>Obligation to Pay</u>. Company shall pay Brightcove the fees set forth in an Order in accordance with the payment terms set forth in this Agreement and each Order. Company shall be responsible for and shall pay any applicable sales, use or other taxes or duties, tariffs or the like applicable to Company's Order (except for taxes on Brightcove's income). All payments shall be made without deduction for withholding taxes. Late payments may be subject to fees at the rate of 1.5% per month or, if lower, the maximum rate allowed by law. If Company fails to pay applicable fees when payment is due, then in addition to any other rights Brightcove may have, Brightcove shall have the right to suspend delivery of all or a portion of the Brightcove Service to Company, provided that Brightcove has supplied Company prior notice and 5 days' opportunity to cure.

In the event of the termination or expiration of this Agreement, all licenses granted under this Agreement shall terminate automatically.

**THIS SECTION 19 APPLIES <u>ONLY</u> TO VIDEO CLOUD EXPRESS EDITION ORDERS AND APP CLOUD PRO EDITION ORDERS PURCHASED VIA CREDIT CARD. THIS SECTION 19 DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY OTHER EDITION OF THE BRIGHTCOVE SERVICE THAT MAY BE PURCHASED BY COMPANY.**

2. <u>App Cloud Pro Plan Entitlements</u>. From time to time, Brightcove may offer one or more App Cloud Pro editions to customers (each, an "App Cloud Pro Plan").

3. <u>Definitions</u>. As used in this Section 19, "Entitlements" means the applicable Video Cloud Express Entitlements and/or the applicable App Cloud Pro Entitlements; "Plan" means the applicable Video Cloud Express Plan and/or the applicable App Cloud Pro Plan; and "Credit Card Order" means any Order in which Company purchases a Plan via a credit card transaction.

b. <u>Credit Card Charges</u>. By submitting a Credit Card Order, Company agrees that Brightcove is authorized (and will continue to be authorized until the Credit Card Order is terminated) to charge a monthly service fee, any applicable additional usage fees and any applicable taxes to the credit card Company provided in connection with its Credit Card Order. Company acknowledges and agrees that the amount charged may vary from month to month due to additional usage fees incurred by Company pursuant to its Plan and/or changes Company makes to its Plan.  Company authorizes Brightcove to charge Company's credit card for such varying amounts.  All fees are payable in the currency specified in Company's Credit Card Order.

1. <u>Monthly Service Fees</u>. Upon submission of a Credit Card Order, Brightcove will charge Company's credit card for the first month of the Plan Company has selected, prorated for the number of days remaining in the month in which the Credit Card Order is submitted. Thereafter, monthly service fees will be charged to Company's credit card in advance on or around the first day of each calendar month until the Credit Card Order is terminated. Brightcove does not guarantee that Company's credit card will be charged by a specific day of the month.
2. <u>Additional Usage Fees</u>. If Company exceeds any of the monthly Entitlements in its Plan at any point during the month, Brightcove will charge Company's Credit Card the applicable additional usage fees identified in Company's Order on or around the first day of the calendar month following the month in which such additional usage fees are incurred by Company.

c. <u>No Refunds</u>. All fees are nonrefundable. For clarity and avoidance of doubt, Brightcove shall have no obligation to issue refunds or credits for any unused Entitlements, partial months or in connection with any downgrade, cancellation, termination or otherwise.

d. <u>Fees Charged by Company's Credit Card Issuer, Bank or Financial Institution</u>. Company is solely responsible for any and all fees charged to Company's credit card by Company's credit card issuer, bank or financial institution including, without limitation, membership, overdraft, insufficient funds and over-the-credit-limit fees.

e. <u>Term of Credit Card Orders</u>. The term of each Credit Card Order shall commence when the credit card information Company has submitted in connection with its Credit Card Order has been validated and accepted (the "<u>Order Term</u>"). The Order Term shall continue until this Agreement and/or the Credit Card Order is terminated by either Company or Brightcove in accordance with this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, this Section 19(e) governs the term of Credit Card Orders: Section 5(b) (Term of Orders) does not apply to Credit Card Orders.

f. <u>Changes to Company's Plan</u>.

1. <u>Upgrades to Another Plan</u>. Company may upgrade to a different Video Cloud Express Plan or App Cloud Core, as applicable, at any time through the U/I.

Company's Entitlements will not change to those of the downgraded Plan until the first day of the billing cycle after the downgrade goes into effect.

g. <u>Credit Card Order Information</u>. Company agrees to provide Brightcove with true, accurate and complete information in connection with its Credit Card Order including, without limitation, Company's legal name, address, telephone number, email address and billing information (i.e., credit card number and expiration date) ("<u>Order Information</u>"). Company agrees, throughout the Term, to maintain and promptly update Company's Order Information and any other information Company provides to Brightcove in connection with its use of the Brightcove Service. Brightcove shall have the right to cancel Company's Credit Card Order, upon notice and 5 days' opportunity to cure, if Brightcove determines that Company's Order Information is not accurate or current.

h. <u>Billing Information</u>. Company may change its credit card information or its billing information by updating the "Billing Information" section within the U/I. Only the User who initially provided the credit card information is entitled to access and change Company's credit card information in the U/I. Company acknowledges and agrees that Brightcove may (though is not required to) contact Company from time to time to verify Company's Order Information, including credit card expiration date, provided, however, that Company remains solely responsible for providing accurate and current payment information to Brightcove throughout the Term and if such information is not received by Brightcove, Brightcove may suspend Company's use of the Brightcove Service.

i. <u>Locked Accounts for Payment Failure</u>. If Brightcove is unable to charge Company's credit card for any reason, Brightcove may, in addition to any other rights Brightcove may have, suspend Company's use of the Brightcove Service until such time as all applicable charges are successfully applied to Company's credit card.

j. <u>Cancellations</u>. The monthly service fees (and any applicable additional usage fees) for Company's Plan will continue unless and until this Agreement and/or Company's Credit Card Order is terminated pursuant to Section 6 of this Agreement or cancelled pursuant to this section.

1. <u>Cancellation by Company</u>. Company may cancel any Credit Card Order at any time pursuant to the procedures described in the "Support" section of the U/I. Company's cancellation must be finalized prior to 11:59 pm (Eastern Time) on the last day of the then-current calendar month in order to avoid charges for the following month. Any final charges (monthly service fees and/or any additional usage fees) that have not been charged to Company's credit card prior to cancellation will be charged to Company's credit card following cancellation. <br> Brightcove is not responsible for Company's failure to properly cancel a Credit Card Order, nor is Brightcove responsible for any credit card charges and fees Company may incur as a result of such failure.
2. <u>Cancellation by Brightcove</u>. In addition to any other termination rights Brightcove has under this Agreement, Brightcove may, with at least 30 days' prior notice to Company, cancel Company's Credit Card Order at any time in Brightcove's sole discretion. Any final charges (monthly service fees and/or additional usages fees) that have not been charged to Company's credit card prior to cancellation will be charged to Company's credit card following cancellation.

For clarity and avoidance of doubt, if Company is subject to more than one Credit Card Order, any cancellation of one Credit Card Order pursuant to this section shall terminate such Credit Card Order only.

k. <u>Company's Credit Card Information</u>. Company agrees that Brightcove may share Company's Order Information with third-party credit card processing companies for the purposes of verifying the accuracy of Company's Order Information and processing and charging Company's credit card for Company's Order.

l. <u>Video Cloud Express Plan Definitions</u>. The following terms have the definitions provided below:

1. <u>GB</u>. Means 1,000,000,000 bytes and is the measurement of bandwidth usage. Company shall pay for all GBs transferred by Brightcove, including all ingress traffic and egress traffic related to Video Cloud.
2. <u>Title</u>. Means a video file stored by Company in Company's Video Cloud Account.
3. <u>User</u>. Means a single person, authorized by Company to access and use Company's Video Cloud Account on Company's behalf, with a unique username and associated password.

m. <u>App Cloud Pro Plan Definitions</u>. The following terms have the definitions provided below:

1. <u>Session</u>. Means the launch of an App by an end user and/or when an App is restored from a background, suspended, stopped or other similar state by an end user.
2. <u>User</u>. Means a single person, authorized by Company to access and use Company's App Cloud Account on Company's behalf, with a unique username and associated password.

n. <u>Changes to Fees and the Agreement</u>. With at least 30 days' prior notice to Company, Brightcove may, in its discretion, change the terms (including the fees) and/or Entitlements of Company's Plan. If Company does not agree to such changes, Company will have an opportunity to cancel or change its Credit Card Order prior to such changes going into effect. If Company does not cancel or change its Credit Card Order within such timeframe, Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that its failure to cancel or change its Credit Card Order shall constitute Company's affirmative acceptance of the Plan changes.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
